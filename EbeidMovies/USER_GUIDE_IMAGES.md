- Tap the trash icon to delete

### In the Detail View:
- Tap any movie in the list to see full details
- The full poster image appears at the top (if available)
- Scroll down to see complete movie information
- All CRUD operations work the same (mark watched, delete)

## Tips & Tricks

✅ **Images are Optional**: You can add movies without images
✅ **Any Image Format**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc. all work
✅ **No Size Limit**: Images are automatically optimized
✅ **Fast Loading**: Images are cached for quick access
✅ **Offline Access**: Once loaded, images work offline
✅ **Easy to Change**: Add images later by editing (if edit feature added)

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't select image"
- Make sure you granted photo permissions
- Check Settings → Apps → EbeidMovies → Permissions

### "Image not showing"
- Image might be loading (wait a moment)
- Try selecting the image again
- Restart the app

### "Image looks blurry"
- Use higher resolution images for best quality
- Recommended: 300x450px or larger for posters

## Permissions Explained

The app requests:
- **READ_MEDIA_IMAGES** (Android 13+): Access to select photos
- **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** (older Android): Access to gallery

These permissions are ONLY used when you choose to add movie posters. Your privacy is protected.

## Best Practices

📷 **Use Movie Posters**: Official movie posters work best
🎨 **Portrait Orientation**: Vertical images look better than horizontal
📐 **Good Resolution**: Use clear, high-quality images
🎬 **Consistent Style**: Use similar image types for a cohesive look

## Feature Compatibility

✅ Works on Android 7.0 (API 25) and higher
✅ Compatible with all screen sizes
✅ Supports dark mode
✅ Accessible with screen readers
✅ Works offline after initial load
